You will not be permitted to use generative AI on the midterm test or final exam. While some generative AI tools are currently available for free in Canada, please be warned that these tools have not been vetted by the University of Toronto and might not meet University guidelines or requirements for privacy, intellectual property, security, accessibility, and records retention. Generative AI may produce content which is incorrect or misleading, or inconsistent with the expectations of this course. These tools may even provide citations to sources that don’t exist—and submitting work with false citations is an academic offense. These tools may be subject to service interruptions, software modifications, and pricing changes during the semester.\n\nGenerative AI is not required to complete any aspect of this course, and we caution you to not rely entirely on these tools to complete your coursework. Instead, we recommend treating generative AI as a supplementary tool only for exploration or drafting content. Ultimately, you (and not any AI tool) are responsible for your own learning in this course, and for all the work you submit for credit. It is your responsibility to critically evaluate the content generated, and to regularly assess your own learning independent of generative AI tools. Overreliance on generative AI may give you a false sense of how much you’ve actually learned, which can lead to poor performance on the midterm test or final exam, in later courses, or in future work or studies after graduation.","type":"content","url":"/syllabus#artifical-intelligence","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Syllabus","lvl3":"Accommodations","lvl2":"Course Syllabus for STA272H1 Winter 2026"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/syllabus#accommodations","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Syllabus","lvl3":"Accommodations","lvl2":"Course Syllabus for STA272H1 Winter 2026"},"content":"If you have a consideration that may require accommodations, please contact Accessibility Services: \n\nhttps://​www​.studentlife​.utoronto​.ca​/as, 416-978-8060 or \n\naccessibility​.services@utoronto​.ca","type":"content","url":"/syllabus#accommodations","position":17}]}
