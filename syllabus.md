# Course Syllabus for STA272H1 Winter 2026

## Meeting times

Class: Thursday 15:00 - 17:00

Tutorial: Thursday 17:00 - 18:00

## Contact Information and Office Hours

Professor Meredith Franklin (Office hours: Wednesday 1500 - 1600)

Professor Nathan Taback (Office hours: Wednesday 1500 - 1600)



## Marking Scheme

- **21%** weekly tutorial assignments (three lowest marks will be dropped).  There will be no makeup tutorial assignments.

  - NB: *Part I of these assignments will be due by the end of tutorial (Thursday by 18:30) and Part II will be due by 12:00 the following class.*  

- **24%** midterm test on Feb. 12 during class (if the midterm is missed then the weight will be shifted to the final exam).

- **55%** final exam. The time and date of the exam is scheduled by the Faculty of Arts and Science.


## Missed / Late Assessment Policy

- Documentation is required to shift the weight of a missed tutorial assignment or midterm test. The following are recognized forms of documentation:

   - Absence Declaration via ACORN
   - U of T Verification of Illness or Injury Form (VOI)
   - College Registrar's letter
   - Letter of Academic Accommodation from Accessibility Services

- Submitting a tutorial assignment after the deadline (for parts I or II) will result in a late penalty of 10% per hour.  Submissions after 10 hours will receive a zero unless documentation to support a request for academic consideration is submitted within one day (i.e., Friday by 18:00).  In this case half the weight of the tutorial assignment will be shifted to the midterm and the other half to the final exam.

- If the midterm test is missed for a valid reason and appropriate documentation is submitted then the weight will be shifted to the final exam.  In this case the final exam will be worth 79%. 

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand parts of data science workflows including data collection, transformation, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and decision making
* Define a statistical model
* Explain the role of statistical modeling in data science
* Formulate research and analysis questions using data and models
* Describe and assess the limitations of statistical models
* Identify scenarios where specific statistical models are appropriate
* Explain how data collection methods and data provenance impact modeling and decision-making


## Artifical Intelligence

In this course, you may use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and GitHub Copilot, as learning aids and to help complete assignments. You will not be permitted to use generative AI on the midterm test or final exam. While some generative AI tools are currently available for free in Canada, please be warned that these tools have not been vetted by the University of Toronto and might not meet University guidelines or requirements for privacy, intellectual property, security, accessibility, and records retention. Generative AI may produce content which is incorrect or misleading, or inconsistent with the expectations of this course. These tools may even provide citations to sources that don’t exist—and submitting work with false citations is an academic offense. These tools may be subject to service interruptions, software modifications, and pricing changes during the semester.

Generative AI is not required to complete any aspect of this course, and we caution you to not rely entirely on these tools to complete your coursework. Instead, we recommend treating generative AI as a supplementary tool only for exploration or drafting content. Ultimately, you (and not any AI tool) are responsible for your own learning in this course, and for all the work you submit for credit. It is your responsibility to critically evaluate the content generated, and to regularly assess your own learning independent of generative AI tools. Overreliance on generative AI may give you a false sense of how much you’ve actually learned, which can lead to poor performance on the midterm test or final exam, in later courses, or in future work or studies after graduation.
