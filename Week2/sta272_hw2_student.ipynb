Download this file (`sta272_hw2_student.ipynb`) from JupyterHub. (See [our JupyterHub Guide](../guides/jupyterhub_guide.ipynb) for detailed instructions.)\n2. Submit this file to MarkUs under the hw2 assignment. (See [our MarkUs Guide](../guides/markus_guide.ipynb) for detailed instructions.)\n\nAll homeworks will take place in a Jupyter notebook (like this one). When you are done, you will download this notebook and submit it to MarkUs.",
